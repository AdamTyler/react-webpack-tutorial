=====================
An ejected [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) application for demonstrating more advanced webpack configuration.

## Installation
```bash
npm i
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm start:prod`

Runs the app in production mode. The build step is run automatically before starting the app via a npm *pre* command.<br>
