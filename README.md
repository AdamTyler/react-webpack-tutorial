## Tutorial Outline

Each step is tagged so that it's easy to check out the tutorial at any step by using:
```bash
git checkout [TAG]
```

To see the changes made between tags:
```bash
git diff [TAG_1]..[TAG_2]
```

Here are the tags in chronological order:

### `react-create-app-init`
- The default app generated by react-create-app

### `react-create-app-eject`
- The app after ejecting react-create-app: `npm run eject`

### `express`
- Adds a simple [Express](http://expressjs.com/) server for serving the production build.

### `vendor-bundle`
- Seperate app and vendor assets using Webpack `CommonsChunkPlugin`.

### `long-term-cache`
- Use `CommonsChunkPlugin` to generate a seperate manifest.js including the Webpack runtime as well as the chunk mapping.
- Configure [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin) to order assets correctly in the production build.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm start:prod`

Runs the app in production mode. The build step is run automatically before starting the app via a npm *pre* command.<br>
